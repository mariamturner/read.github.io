This book is hefty and full of juicy info. I'm storing my notes here because I am afraid that I will not be able to store all of them in my head, and while I prefer to write by hand, this book is simply too long.

I also want to perform some psychological tests on myself: i.e. can I use this information to condition myself to think a certain way? The whole concept of "affirmations" sounds silly to me. I have trouble convincing myself that meditation works, let alone that repeating words to myself that I don't believe will make me more inclined to believe them.

I think there are things I can take away from this book and experiment with in my day-to-day life. For example, anchoring or priming positivity with nods. Ideally, I want to find a way to condition myself to enjoy rainy days during quarantine, i.e., can I find a way to assign a meaning or purpose to each type of day and can I trick myself into believing/embodying those associations? Can I create a sense of cognitive ease that extends across all types of weather, quantity of interaction with other people, energy, sleep, and stress by giving each of those types of days a "home"? If the sunny day belongs to reading books and learning all day outside on the patio, then maybe the cloudy day belongs to art projects, cooking, and writing in the study with lots of light.

Anyway, I will collect all my notes here and document my experimental findings.

Some random things I think I can anchor:
- weekly budget (anchor low)
- weekly mileage (anchor high)
- weekly readings (anchor high)
- hours slept (anchor high)
- 

Some random things I can prime:
- nod when the Barry's instructor is hyping me up or explaining the workout
- read morning affirmations out loud and ~nod~ (lol)
- nod in a disagreement to empathize more with the other person
- 

**Introduction**

- intelligent gossip allows us to observe distinctive patterns in the errors people make
- systematic errors = biases
- people are good intuitive grammarians but not statisticians
- simplifying heuristic: rule of thumb
- availability heuristic: reliance on the ease of memory search
- approach to doing this research is a self-research of sorts
- if a heuristic is a mental shortcut, a bias is a distinctive pattern in errors made
- intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition - the idea of expert intuition is a myth
- affect heuristic: judgments and decisions are guided directly by feelings of liking and disliking, with little deliberation or reasoning
- intuitive heuristics -> when faced with a difficult question, we often substitute with an easier one without noticing
- question: what is prospect theory?
- framing effects; tendency to treat problems in isolation
- super excited for ch 5: distinction between the two selves, the experiencing self and the remembering self: this is something I face and notice!! We can exploit the automatic formation of memories so the worse episode leaves a better memory.

My question here is that it kind of feels like it might be in your best interest to pursue what satisfies the remembering self as opposed to the experiencing self, to optimize for long-term happiness. That's a bittersweet thought though. Reminds us that there is no such thing as happiness according to biologists :-) @Sapiens


##### PT I. TWO SYSTEMS

**The Characters of the Story**

Describes System 1 and System 2. Gives examples of each one at play.

Df. System 1
operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.
Df. System 2
allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. Subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.

- control of attention is shared by the two systems.
- you can set your memory.
- paying attention is legit: you have a budget, use it as you choose. If you go beyond your budget, you will fail. Effortful activities interfere with each other: you might be able to multitask with System 1 tasks, but if you try to perform two tasks requiring System 2 at once, you will fail. 
- our social behavior even makes allowances for these limitations (driving)
- interaction between the two: System 1 generates suggestions for System 2 in the form of intuitions, impressions, intentions, feelings - if ENDORSED by System 2, these turn into beliefs and voluntary actions
- think about being "surprised": System 2 is activated when an event is detected that violates the model of the world that System 1 maintains
- System 2 monitors your own behavior
- Visual illusions; cognitive illusions (think about the psychopathic patient)
- premise of book: it is easier to recognize other people's mistakes than our own

A learning/memorization takeaway: the same way the author personifies System 1 and System 2 in his sentences, I can personify objects or concepts to make them easier for me to digest and remember.

One way to make the work day easier might be to optimize types of work for what times of day I can best activate System 2.

**Attention and Effort**

- System 2 is the supporting character who believes herself to be the hero and we are LAZY out here we do not want to work unless we must so we rely heavily on System 1, way more than we realize
- example of Add-1, Add-3
- Pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort - makes it easy to conduct legit experiments
- you "relax" as soon as you 'unload' your short-term memory
- I like the analogy of "electricity" or brain power: The toaster requires a certain amount of power; the hair dryer requires a certain amount of power, the oven requires a certain amount of power. You can't change this, but you know what power will be required before choosing to use one of these appliances. Your pupil is an indicator of the amount of power various activities require of you.
- HOWEVER, things change in the event of overload - if you overload your circuits, everything breaks. If you overload your brain, System 2 will protect the most important activity and "spare capacity" will be allocated second by second to other tasks.
- Again, we are LAZY out here: if there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action. **"In the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs."**
- Goes over what activities require real effort (what can System 2 do that System 1 cannot)
- System 2 can follow rules, compare objects on multiple attributes, and make deliberate choices between options. System 2 can perform "task sets" (count all the 'f's on this page) THIS IS EXECUTIVE CONTROL - also whenever a conflict must be resolved
- switching from one task to another is effortful, especially under time pressure.
- time pressure also drives effort
- **"the most effortful forms of slow thinking are those that require you to think fast"**
- we avoid mental overload by CACHING: committing intermediate results to LT memory or to paper. Dividing our tasks into multiple easy steps.

Ok, so can you create this control for yourself? I'm thinking that there might be a way to increase engagement with material, especially reading material, by doing this. If you create conflict, you are forced to acknowledge it and make it make sense. I try to do this by asking questions as I read and challenging stuff I don't think makes sense. My concern here would be that the way you "make it make sense" might be uninformed or come to a false conclusion, but I think creating conflict is a good way to increase engagement.

Another potential application: how can I cache info effectively? Is this actually a useful practice, or will this just inhibit my ability to get through material since I'm trying to avoid committing stuff to my working memory? I'm thinking that this might be more useful for engineering stuff. By designing the entire thing first and taking the time to work out the design in a way that makes sense, I can then go in and break everything into micro-tasks. Woohoo agile. But seriously. If I only have to worry about building things in tiny tiny increments, and if I can test each of these increments thoroughly before moving on, I will a) have a less stressful build experience b) write more robust code.
